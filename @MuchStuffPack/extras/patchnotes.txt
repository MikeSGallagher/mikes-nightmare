Patch notes:
- Added lamps | You can use car/truck batteries with wires to connect them and turn them on for lighting up your base. In future more options will be added. 
Please refrain from using too many lights in base if you value your client FPS (this is a dayz engine issue)

    - Standing Wood Lamp
- Moved gunwall slightly back to sit better on walls
- Moved medical box slightly lower
